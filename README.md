## IoT Course – Activities and Projects
*In Progress at SENAI*  

**Course:** Technical Course in Systems Development

**Subject:** Internet of Things

**Instructor:** Raphael Machado

This repository contains activities and projects developed in the IoT subject of the Technical Course in Systems Development at SENAI. Throughout the course, we would explore core concepts of the Internet of Things (IoT), including sensors, actuators, microcontrollers such as ESP32 and Arduino UNO, and practical applications of these technologies.

The materials focus on understanding IoT fundamentals, working with hardware components, and programming embedded systems to create smart, connected devices.

### Getting Started

To work with the microcontroller projects (ESP32, Arduino UNO), you will need:

- Arduino IDE or PlatformIO (recommended) installed on your computer
- Proper drivers for your hardware (ESP32/Arduino UNO)
- USB cable to connect the boards to your PC

If you don’t have the hardware available or want to quickly test code without physical devices, you can use Wokwi — an online simulator for Arduino and ESP32 projects.
